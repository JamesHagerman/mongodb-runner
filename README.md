## Requirements

NA

## Extension Settings

Setup MongoDB Connection in your workspace setting. 

```json
"mongoRunner": {
        "connection": {
            "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
            "activeOnStartUp": true,
            "user": "username",
        }
    }
```

In order to secure user's password, we don't support put password in the configuration file as plain text. Instead, when you specify the user name in the configuration file, `MongoDB Runner` will prompt you to input the password.


### SSL Connection

For SSl connection, please use `options` configuration. You can also put all other mongo connection options there.

```json
"mongoRunner": {
        "connection": {
            "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
            "activeOnStartUp": true,
            "user": "username",
            "options": {
                "ssl": true
            }
        }
    }
```

### Private key connection setting

```json
"mongoRunner": {
        "connection": {
            "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
            "activeOnStartUp": true,
            "user": "username",
            "options": {
                "sslCert": "/Users/Document/mongodb.pem",
                "sslKey": "/Users/Document/mongodb-cert.key",
                "ssl": true
            }
